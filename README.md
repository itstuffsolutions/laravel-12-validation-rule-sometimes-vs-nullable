## Overview

Validating user input correctly is fundamental in Laravel applications to ensure data integrity and security. Two validation rules that often cause confusion are `sometimes` and `nullable`:

- **`sometimes`**: Only runs validation rules if the input is present in the request.  
- **`nullable`**: Always allows a field to be null or empty, and skips further rules if it is null/empty.

This blog post explains how they differ, provides real-world examples, discusses best practices, and helps you decide when to use each in Laravel 12 projects. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Core Differences

- `sometimes`: Validate **only if** the field is present in the request.  
- `nullable`: Fields are always in the request (or considered), but may be null/empty and bypass further rules.  
- They can be combined (`sometimes|nullable`) for flexible behavior. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## `sometimes` Validation Rule

- Syntax: `'field_name' => 'sometimes|other_rules'`  
- Behavior:  
  - If the field **is not present** in the request → no validation is run.  
  - If it **is present** (even if empty) → other validation rules apply.  
  - Does **not** allow null/empty by itself (unless combined with `nullable`).
- Use cases: partial updates, optional API parameters, optional file uploads.
